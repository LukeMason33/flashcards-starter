# FlashCards
Do you like getting quizzed on all that knowledge that big brain holds? Then you've come to the right place!
This program here is a flashcard quiz that is played in the terminal. It will ask you a question with 3 possible choices as the answer. Scroll through the answers using your arrow keys, and once you think you have the right one highlighted, click enter to see if you are correct!
Each time you answer a question, the next one will be prompted to you
Once you have answered all of them, the console will indicate that the round is over and what your score is.

## Installation
- First you'll want to clone down this repo
- Then you'll want to run "npm install" in your console.
- After that, you'll enter "node index.js" which will then kick off the game!
